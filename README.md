This system improves services delivered to end users. Information can be searched from the system and the results displayed in a timely manner. Costs incurred are reduced by cutting down the number of library workforce. Data is saved in the most appropriate manner eliminating duplication and redundancy. Multiple users can access the system at the same time. The system operates electronically hence ensures less space is occupied and also presents a paperless working environment. The goal of coming up with this system was to design, develop, and implement a fully automated online library book management system.
